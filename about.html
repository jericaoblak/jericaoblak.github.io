          Most of Oblak’s electronic music is composed in her musical system "Augmentation Matrix.” It is a process of modifying perceptual consonance by applying stretched harmonic synthesis to the corresponding microtonal tuning and spectral structuring. New intervalic hierarchies based on pseudo-octaves allow her to experiment with alternative sonic and harmonic algorithms. Jerica Oblak’s theoretical interest also lies in the research of film music. She focuses on the contextual analysis of sound-image counterpoint and the exploration of our cross-domain perception. Her Ph.D. dissertation and her thesis defended at the University of Ljubljana are among the earliest capstone writings on the topic.
