            “Augmentation Matrix” is Dr. Oblak’s micro-tonal/spectral musical theory based on the proportional manipulation of the harmonic series. It is designed to alter a listener’s perception of consonant/dissonant relationships thus creating an alternative intervallic hierarchy in favor of new pseudo-octaves. The application of the idea utilizes additive synthesis, stretched harmonic tunings, and compositional structuring based on specific inharmonics. All her recent acoustic and electronic works explore various applications of the system.

            Dr. Oblak’s special theoretical interest lies in the research of film music. She focuses on the contextual analysis of sound-image counterpoint and questions the meanings/values of film music through a philosophical and perceptual reframing of our collective audio-visual consciousness. Her Ph.D. dissertation deals with the analysis of nondiegetic film music; a case study applied to the film Altered States, a collaboration between Ken Russell and John Corigliano. Her thesis defended at the University of Ljubljana is a general introduction to the theory of film music.
